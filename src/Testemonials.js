                Audrey has been worship leading for almost 14 years in many capacities. Audrey’s 
                dad is a full time musician and worship leader who taught her much of what she knows. 
                She plays guitar, piano, bass, and she mostly loves to sing. She has learned lots over 
                the years from her fellow leaders, mentors, and father.
                Audrey is eager to share what she has learned with other leaders and to learn from them!

                Her philosophy boils down to this: Worship music is an opportunity for everyone involved 
                to engage in guided prayer to the God of the Universe. A worship leaders’ job is to prepare 
                the band enough so that their mistakes are not a distraction from the work the Holy Spirit 
                is doing in the hearts of the congregation.

                Music has been a large part of Luke's entire life. He started playing
                piano at the age of 6 and took classical lessons through his sophomore 
                year in college, participating in various piano competitions and concerts.
                In addition to his classical training Luke took 4 years of jazz theory that
                greatly informs his style and playing and allowed him to play numerous
                gigs at restaurants and weddings throughout highschool and college.

                While he was developing his style and technique on the keyboard, Luke also
                frequently led worship from the front with his guitar for school worships
                and evening worships at summer camp. Here at WWU Luke was a Vespers band 
                leader his Freshman and Sophomore years and became the Assistant Chaplain for
                Music his Junior and Senior years.

                In the last couple years Luke has spent his free time teaching several young 
                piano students to expand their playing beyond the page and improvise with 
                various tools and "cheats" that he's developed over his years of playing. 
                Several of his students were able to use these tips and tricks to play in 
                a worship band after only a couple months of instruction. Luke is very excited
                to share some of these techniques with fellow pianists in this workshop.
