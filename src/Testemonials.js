                opportunity to be a small group leader for a few quarters my junior year. 
                The people in the group didn't know each other at first, but as the weeks went 
                on we became close friends. It was so wonderful gathering for an hour, once a week, 
                and reflecting how God was moving in our lives. I grew so much that year and learned 
                so much from the people in that group."

                "When I was in a small group last year I loved the surprise of having the outcomes 
                differ from my expectations. I thought that small groups would "blow my mind," with 
                concepts that were unique and transformative every time that we would meet. Rather, 
                I found that my soul was not craving epiphanies, but rather fellowship. Having a 
                consistent community of people that are focused on Christ and on love was a powerful 
                thing."

                "Sometimes after the worship part of small groups ended, that's when I felt the 
                strongest presence of the Holy Spirit. The post-worship conversations, fellowships, 
                and just hanging out was my favorite aspect of small groups."
